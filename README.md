# HomePrices

Project git for Intro to Data Science group project, Fall 2019
Lars Bosgraaf, Bill Sendewicz, Stas Sochynskyi

We did our group project on the Kaggle competition House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques: Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting. 

The files:

Home_Prices_ONE-HOT_ENCODING.ipynb, 
group_project.ipynb, 
group_project_test_preprocessing.ipynb, and
test_data_solution.ipynb

were where we did our data cleaning, one-hot encoding, preprocessing, replaced NAs, and where we tried doing some feature selection.

The file Model_testing.ipynb is where we ran different models with different feature counts and tested various models. This is where the main regression analysis took place.

PCR.html was the result of trying to do principal component regression, which wasn't successful.

This git also contains M1_report.pdf, which was our CRISP-DM report prior to the main modeling work we did. The file Group_M01_IDS_Project_Poster_Lars_Bosgraaf_Bill_Sendewicz_Stas_Sochynskyi.pptx.pdf is the poster file we submitted on December 15, 2019 and presented on Thursday, December 19, 2019 at the Intro to Data Science poster presentation session.
